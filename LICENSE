Hi!

We're GalaxyICS team.
Why we didn't updated our sources for a long time?

You can say thanks to all guys, who has used our work and they lied it's made by they.

We wanted to be open, but trust me, it's really annoying.

Now, we're going back to opensource.

So, if you really must to use this sources, remember:
1. We don't supporting user with CM9 with any other kernel installed. DON'T FORGET TO WRITE ABOUT THAT IN YOUR TOPIC!
2. DON'T FORGET TO WRITE USING BIG LETTERS ON TOP OF YOUR TOPIC IT'S BUILT USING OUR SOURCES.

It's all for now, thank you.
Maclaw
